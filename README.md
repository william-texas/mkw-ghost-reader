# mkw-ghost-reader
This script (ghost_reader.py) will read the information of a mario kart wii ghost file that is placed in the same directory and is named 'ghost.rkg'. It will also provide a link to view the mii data used in the ghost, and also inform the user whether the ghost originated from the CTGP Ghost Database or not.
